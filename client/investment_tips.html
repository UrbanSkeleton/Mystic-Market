            <li><strong>Buy low, sell high.</strong> However, don't wait too long for the “perfect” opportunity—markets are unpredictable.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Short-Term vs Long-Term Gain.</strong> Short-term is volatile with high risk and reward. Long-term is steadier, leading to wealth accumulation over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Figure out your risk tolerance.</strong> Determine how much risk you're willing to take with your investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Time in the market matters more than timing the market.</strong> Long-term investment benefits from compound interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversify your portfolio.</strong> Investing in multiple assets reduces risk in case one investment fails.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.</strong> Be mindful of your financial limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Never invest in something you don't understand.</strong> Do proper research before making investment decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust facts over emotions.</strong> Emotional investing can lead to poor financial decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Set realistic expectations.</strong> Investing is a long-term strategy, not a get-rich-quick scheme.</li>
            <li><strong>Patience is key.</strong> Markets fluctuate, but long-term growth requires staying the course.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish an emergency fund.</strong> Never invest money needed for essential expenses like food, housing, or gas.</li>
            <li><strong>Some investments have higher taxes than others.</strong> Be aware of tax implications before investing.</li>
            <li><strong>Beware of get-rich-quick schemes.</strong> If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek professional help if needed.</strong> A financial advisor can provide guidance tailored to your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Figure out your investing style.</strong> Choose between active investing, passive investing, or a hybrid approach.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan your budget for investing.</strong> Determine how much you can invest initially and over time.</li>
